# Black Friday

### A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

### Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

Through this project, I learnt the importance of feature engineering for a predictive model, combininig existing features, removing features, using Ridge regression for smoothening the your linear model, calculating alpha for your Ridge regression model and determining wheather the output data should be normalized or not.

-This project was first done using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio and then Python was used. The result were then compared.
